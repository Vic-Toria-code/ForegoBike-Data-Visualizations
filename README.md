# (FORGO BIKE DATASET EXPLORATION)
## by (Victoria Nyaguthii)


## Dataset

> The datset consist of 183412 records and 16 features on a bikehiring system.The data gives details such as year of birth of users,the duration taken for each hire,their starting and ending stations and in addition their latitudes which would help in mapping out the location of the bike hire service.
>The dataset can be found in the
repository for R's ggplot2 library here(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag02/ford-gobike-2019feb-tripdata/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)


## Summary of Findings

> It was noted that there could be possible incorrect data since the maximum age of a bike rider was 144 which could be in accurate.THere also was a chunk of missing data on the year of birth column which will be droped as it is not valuable to the exploration.
>There are three categories of gender that is female,male and other.Giving a specific gender would benefit the exploration in getting more meaning from the dataset given.
>The riders are given some bike shares for each trip they make.This would probably be determined by other factors which could be the user type,or the duration,we shall find out during the exploration.
>I also noted that the number of male users were relatively higher than the rest memegr genders in the dataset.
>The hire bike services categorizes its users into either customers or subscribers where we find most users are subscribers compared to the customers and in return,they are the only users awarded bike shares for any trip made.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>My main focus was the top 20 bikes that had taken the most trips where i found bike id 4794 to have the most trips in the datset.
>I also calculated the age of the members based on the cuurent year 2022 and found the distribution of the riders to be mostly positively skewed where  most riders laid between 28 and 37.It was remarkable to note some few users aged 60 and above hiring the bikes.
